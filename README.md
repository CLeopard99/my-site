# React Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio website, built with React and SCSS, developed to showcase my skills and experiment with React packages.
This website is fully responsive and can be found at: https://charlieleopard.dev/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br />
Other packages used can be found in package.json.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm/yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm/yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
