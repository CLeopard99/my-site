# React Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio website, built with React and SCSS, developed to showcase my skills and projects as a software developer and experiment with React packages. This website is fully responsive and made for maintainability and reusability - it can be found at: [charlieleopard.dev](https://charlieleopard.dev/).

The website includes:

- Home-page: Introduction, link to pdf resume, shortcut buttons, and particle animation

- About: Education section with accordion and skills section with skilltabs that are easy to add

- Projects: Portfolio of projects with name, technologies, summary, examples, and buttons for github/video demo

- More: Section on other activities include photo collage, overlay windows, and interests list

- Contact: Simple contact footer with email button

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is hosted using Firebase.
